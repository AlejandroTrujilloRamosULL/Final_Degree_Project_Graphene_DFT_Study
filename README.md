# Final_Degree_Project_Graphene_DFT_Study
GitHub repository with the files and codes used to obtain the results for the Graphene DFT Study.
Here we add the main files used to calculate via the computational tools VASP and Phonopy the electronic and vibrational properties of Graphene, and also the Python codes
used for this task.
